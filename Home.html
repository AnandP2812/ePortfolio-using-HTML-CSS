            <p class="MainText"> My name is Anand Prajapati, and I am currently studying Computing at Manchester Metropolitan University. In my spare time, I enjoy using After Effects to create compositions with the use of visual effects - this is something I have a huge interest in; I have developed my skills through tutorials on the internet over time. When I do get time, though, I try to learn more advanced visual effects in order to create something more extraordinary. I chose to study Computing at MMU because I knew that Java is something that is currently in demand - therefore I wanted to develop those skills to maybe develop something of my own in the future. Along with that, another reason why I chose Computing was because it included web development. This is something I have an interest in because I do already have some knowledge on HTML and CSS - and I wanted to expand my knowledge on web development by learning how to add animations using Javascript.
