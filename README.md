# ePortfolio-using-HTML-CSS
An e-portfolio (electronic portfolio) website created using HTML and CSS, showing a collection of evidence of my learning journey during my first year at university. The purpose of this website was to share some information about myself; reflect, evaluate and comment on my units; and discuss how I could improve my skills in the future.
