# ePortfolio using HTML/CSS

#### Author: Anand Prajapati

An e-portfolio (electronic portfolio) website created using HTML and CSS, showing a collection of evidence of my learning journey during my first year at university. The purpose of this website was to share some information about myself; reflect, evaluate and comment on my units; and discuss how I could improve my skills in the future (i.e. a development plan). This website was completed in November 2017.


## Setting up the Website
1. Download and save the project as a zip.
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Open the folder.
4. Double click "Home.html".
5. Enjoy looking at my website. Thanks.
